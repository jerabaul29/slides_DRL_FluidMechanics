class Env(object):
    """The main OpenAI Gym class. It encapsulates an environment with
    arbitrary behind-the-scenes dynamics. An environment can be
    partially or fully observed.
    The main API methods that users of this class need to know are:
        step
        reset
        render
        close
        seed
    And set the following attributes:
        action_space: The Space object corresponding to valid actions
        observation_space: The Space object corresponding to valid observations
        reward_range: A tuple corresponding to the min and max possible rewards
    Note: a default reward range set to [-inf,+inf] already exists. Set
    it if you want a narrower range.
    The methods are accessed publicly as "step", "reset", etc.. The
    non-underscored versions are wrapper methods to which we may add
    functionality over time.
